1.Locate the .html File: In the repository, look for the .html file that corresponds to the .rmd file you want to open. This .html file is typically generated by knitting the .rmd file to HTML using RStudio or a similar tool.

2.Click on the .html File: Once you've found the .html file, click on its name to open it in GitHub's file viewer.

3.Copy Permalink: Now, look at the address bar of your web browser. You'll see a URL that represents the permalink to the .html file on GitHub. Copy this URL.

4.Open HTML Preview Site: Visit htmlpreview.github.io in your web browser. This site allows you to preview HTML files hosted on GitHub by providing the URL.

5.Paste Permalink into HTML Preview Site: Once you're on the HTML Preview site, paste the permalink you copied earlier into the provided text field.

6.View Better Visual Experience: After pasting the permalink, hit the "Preview" button on the HTML Preview site. This will load and display the .html file generated from the .rmd file, providing a better visual experience compared to viewing the raw Markdown or R code directly on GitHub.
