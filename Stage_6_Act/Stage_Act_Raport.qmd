## Quarto

This document was made in Quarto. I'm also making comparison between `R Markdown` and `Quarto` for making raports.

This is the last stage: Act

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
